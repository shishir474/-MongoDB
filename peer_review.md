# Peer Review

# 1. Rajkeshav

Used pymongo to make a connection to the mongodb database.
Used subprocess library to load data into the database.
Created separate files for analyzing the comments, movies and theaters dataset.
Created separate functions for each query and mentioned the query inside of a pipeline, executed this pipeline using the aggregate function and printed the final output.
Each function is written generically, where if any query requires top n results or results from a given year, all these attributes are passed in as function parameters
Used indexes where required to optimize the query.
